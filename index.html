			Interacting With Data: Voter Trends and Turnouts</p>
    	<h2> Part 1 - Voting habits </h2>
		<h3> Does frequency of voting change with income and education levels? </h3>
    	<iframe src="categories.html" title="Parallel categories plot of voter habits" width = "100%" height = "60%" 
    	frameBorder="0"></iframe> 
		<p>This parallel categories plot aims to display the relationship between voting frequency, education, and income.
		<u>High voting frequency (always vote)</u> is shown to be correlated with <u>higher education</u> levels as 
		well as a higher education. The opposite trend is also displayed.
		Those who rarely or never vote tend to have some college or less.</p>

		<h2> Part 2 - Voter turnout and absentee voting through the years</h2>
		<h3> How did voter turnout and absentee voting change in Virginia General Elections 
			 from 2014 to 2022?</h3>
		<iframe src="bubble.html" title="bubble chart of voter turnout and absentee voting" width = "70%" height = "105%" 
    	frameBorder="0"></iframe>
		<p>The bubble plot aims to visualize and emphasize the differences in 
		percent turnout and percent absentee voting between 2014-2022 with a simple animation. Here we can see that
		<u>2020</u> looks much different from the rest of the years. This year has a much higher 
		percent of absentee voters than all other years, as shown by the bubbles being much higher on 
		the y-axis. This is very likely, if not definitely, due to 
		the effects of the <u>Covid-19 pandemic</u> preventing large gatherings, thus absentee ballots were 
		encouraged to stop the spread of Covid-19</p>

		<h2> Part 3 - Map of voter turnout in Virginia counties and cities</h2>
		<h3> What did voter turnout look like in cities and counties in Virginia in the 2022 general election?</h3>
		<iframe src="map.html" title="choropleth map of voter turnout in Virginia" width = "100%" height = "100%" 
    	frameBorder="0"></iframe>
		<p> Here, the percent turnout for different cities and counties in Virginia is 
		displayed on a choropleth map to allow for easier visualization of regional differences.
		The darker shades of green tend to be concentrated in the <u>central/upper regions</u> of Virginia. 
		The western regions of Virginia also tend to have much lower turnouts than 
		anywhere else. The map also displays a positive gradient in voter turnout when travelling from 
		western to eastern Virginia.</p>
